h1. Nginx Accept Language module

This module parses the Accept-Language header and gives the most suitable locale for the user from a list of supported locales from your website.

h3. Example configuration:

  set_from_accept_language $lang en ja pl;
  where $lang is the variable in which to store the locale
  and en ja pl are the locales supported by your website
  
If none of the locales from accept_language is available on your website, it sets the variable to the first locale of your website's supported locales (in this case en)
  
  
Note: It currently assumes that the accept-language is sorted by quality values (from my tests it's the case for safari, firefox, opera and ie) and discards q (see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). In the situation where I'm using the module, this assumption works... but buyer beware :-)


h3. Why did I create it? 

I'm using page caching with merb on a multi-lingual website and I needed a way to serve the correct language page from the cache
I'll soon put an example on http://gom-jabbar.org
